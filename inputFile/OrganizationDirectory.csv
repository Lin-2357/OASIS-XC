For those looking to join our design family, we look for those passionate about design innovation, compassionate towards beneficial causes, thrive in team environments, and would benefit socially and professionally from joining our design community.   We table on Sproul the first two seeks of the semester, hold two infosessions to learn more about us, and offer other events and 1:1 opportunities to chat with members of our organization. Our application consists of a two round process. In the first round, we ask a few short questions to gauge interest in design, areas for growth, and interest in joining our design family. Applicants who meet the demonstrated qualities will be invited to complete a design challenge, interview, and teamwork activity. We provide application workshops, office hours, and chat platforms to give all applicants—regardless of experience—the ability to successfully complete their application. We encourage applicants of ALL background to apply!  In addition to our organization, we also teach the HCD DeCal—a fun, project based course that runs through the fundamentals in design and culminates into a final project that can kickstart a design portfolio! Applications for the DeCal are open during the first two weeks of the semester. We offer the DeCal every semester since 2008!  Finally, we host a myriad of activities, workshops, and panels throughout the semester to learn more about and engage with the world of design.

The Haas Consulting Club’s (HCC) mission is to provide students with the resources, training, and connections to Haas staff, alumni, and current students with experience in consulting that will help the HCC members explore the consulting space and assist them with finding a job in the consulting industry.  The club establishes links between consulting firms and Haas students, through the Career Center and fellow Haas students with consulting backgrounds. The club provides members a number of resources needed to succeed in the recruiting process with consulting firms. Our activities can be divided into the following major areas:  Introducing consulting career options to new Haas students Providing links to consulting firms Helping with consulting applications and interviews We hope to provide any assistance we can to get interested students through the recruiting process with workshops and practice with the infamous case interviews. We assist international students as well as students from the United States on both domestic and international opportunities. To establish relationships between firms and students, we sponsor firm night activities, provide contacts with alumni and current students affiliated with various firms, invite guest speakers to address important issues, and compile and distribute a resume book. Email our primary contact and officers for more information on how to get involved with the club."
